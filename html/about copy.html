            <p class="paragraph-text">
              Current evidences suggested that wine was originated in West Asia including Caucasus Mountains, Zagros Mountains, 
              Euphrates River Valley, and Southeastern Anatolia. It also includes modern day nations of Armenia, Azerbaijan,
              Georgia, Nothern Iran, and Eastern Turkey. Acient wine production was believed to be in dates between 6,000 BC and 4,000 BC.
              It includes an ancient winery site in Armenia, grape residue found in clay jars in Georgia, and signs of grape demonstication in
              Eastern Turkey.

              Considered as the "crade of wine" by archaelogists, it has been traced back as the world's first known wine creation back to the people
              of the South Caucasus in 6,000 BC. Early Georgians discovered grape juice could be turned into wine by burying it underground for the
              winter, some of it remained underground for up to 50 years.
